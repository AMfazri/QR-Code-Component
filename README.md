## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I'm using semantic html like <main> instead of using div.

- I learned to make the good commits such as:
  style: apply spacing and typography
  feat: built main layout structure
  feat: add base html structure
  chore: setup google font "Outfit"
  chore: initialize project

- I'm using flex to make the contents centered fully. this is really helpfull instead of using another method

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

in next challange, i want to keep use semantic html5 markup and begin to use css custom properties. i hope using these methods regularly that will make me feel comfort and be a good habitual.
